Issues:
Most of these operators will crash if passed a default-constructed MyString
Your overloaded== could have been one line of code. *Always* use a standard library function if you want to accomplish a standard thing  
(see the assignment...use strcmp). When you do it yourself, everyone is confused that looks at the code because they will waste time  
looking through your code to see what you're doing, they will be frustrated to see that you've just written your own version of the standard  
function that everyone uses.
